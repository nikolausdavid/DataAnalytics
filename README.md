# Data Analytics with Python

This Repository focuses on Learning DataAnalytics related Methods and Approaches using the Python Progamming language with several 
well-known Modules (e.g. Numpy, Pandas). 

The Trendcompass S&P500, which I am currently working on is visible at [my GitHub Webpage](https://nikolausdavid@github.io).

Besides the Trendcompass, there's a few other files in which I tried to Explore Machine Learning and Data Manipulation with Python. 
Cheers, David!
