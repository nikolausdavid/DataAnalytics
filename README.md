# Stock S&P 500 Trendcompass

How the Trendcompass works

In Levy's relative strength concept, the current closing price of the underlying is set in relation to the average of the closing prices of the last 27 weeks. This is a long-term, trend-following approach. A relative strength value greater than 1 means that the current closing price of an underlying base calue is above the average price of the last 27 weeks, which could indicate an upward stock trend. Conversely, values smaller than 1 indicate a below-average development within the last 27 weeks.

Momentum, on the other hand, puts the current closing price in relation to just one past price - in this case, the closing price four weeks ago. A coefficient greater than 1 indicates that the current price of the respective underlying is higher than 4 weeks ago, which could indicate an upward trend. Similar to Levy's relative strength, values smaller than 1 indicate a negative price development of the underlying base value within the period under consideration.

According to this concept, the upper right quadrant contains the stocks for which positive price developments can be identified both according to the long-term concept of relative strength according to Levy and measured by the shorter-term momentum. Stable trends are advantageous for both methods. If, on the other hand, a certain degree of trend continuity is lacking or if there are rapid trend changes, this impairs the informative value of the two concepts. The trend compass initially represents a snapshot, i.e. the values displayed reflect the situation at a fixed point in time
